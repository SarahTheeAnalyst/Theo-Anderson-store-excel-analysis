# Theo-Anderson-store-excel-analysis
I developed an excel project, creating a dashboard and tables to analyse the data.
Insights:
*Customers seem to prefer cashless payments.
*Toronto and Ottawa has the lowest amount of sales therefore those areas need more marketing, while Vancouver has the highest sales amount so it is worth more investment.
*Weekdays bring in more profit than weekends, so more weekend shopping should be encouraged and promoted.
*Soccer, electronics, and apparel brings in high revenue, while other categories sell but they don't generate enough profit, which could be due to the product cost.
*There is more in-store sales than online, so the physical store is very much needed.
